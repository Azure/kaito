# Title
Add phi-2 to Kaito supported model list.

## Glossary
N/A

## Summary

- **Model description**: Launched during Microsoft Ignite last November, Phi-2 model is intended for QA, chat, and code purposes. With only 2.7 billion parameters, Phi-2 impressively surpasses the performance of Mistral and Llama-2 models at 7B and 13B on various aggregated benchmarks. Most notably it achieves better performance compare to the 25x larger llama-2-70B model on particular reasoning tasks like coding and math.
- **Model usage statistics**: In the past month, phi-2 has garnered 535,163 downloads on Hugging Face, reflecting its widespread popularity.
- **Model license**: phi-2 is distributed under the MIT license, ensuring broad usability and modification rights.
