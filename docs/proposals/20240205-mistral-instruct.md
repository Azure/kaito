## Glossary
N/A

## Summary

- **Model description**: Launched last September, Mistral-7B has quickly become a standout among large language models (LLMs) with its 7.3B parameters. It surpasses models nearly twice its size in benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Mistral has also forged strategic alliances with major cloud platforms including Azure, AWS, and GCP. For more information, refer to the [Mistral-7B Documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/) and access the model on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2). The newly introduced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 is an instruct fine-tuned iteration of the original, optimized for understanding and executing specific instructions. This enhances mistral's utility in conversational applications.  
- **Model usage statistics**: In the past month, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 has garnered 424,580 downloads on Hugging Face, reflecting its widespread popularity. Google Trends data shows a high level of search interest in <!-- markdown-link-check-disable --> ["mistral ai 7b"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=mistral%20ai%207b), <!-- markdown-link-check-enable --> indicating strong market curiosity. 
- **Model license**: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license, ensuring broad usability and modification rights.
